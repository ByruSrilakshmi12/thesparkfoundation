The Sparks Foundation Tasks
This repository contains the tasks that I completed while working as an intern for The Sparks Foundation.

Internship Category - Data Science and Business Analytics
Internship Type - Work from Home
#GRIPMAR21 @THESPARKFOUNDATION
In this internship, we were provided a total of 5 Tasks and I was able to successfully complete 5 tasks within the given time-frame.


### Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML(Level - Beginner)

● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

● You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool

● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

● Sample Solution : https://bit.ly/2HxiGGJ


### Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters
and represent it visually.

● Use R or Python or perform this task

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

● Sample Solution : https://bit.ly/3cGyP8j


### Task-3 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail(Level - Beginner)

● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’

● As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can
work to make more profit.

● What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?

● You can choose any of the tool of your choice
(Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS)

● Dataset: https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl

● Beginner Level - Create dashboards. Screen-record along with your

audio explaining the charts and interpretations.



### Task-6 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm(Level - Intermediate)

Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
predict the right class accordingly.

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

● Sample Solution : https://bit.ly/2G6sYx9


### Task-7 : Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis (Level - Advanced)

Objective: Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance
prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and
sentimental analysis of news headlines

● Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)


● Download historical stock prices from finance.yahoo.com

● Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6

● Use either R or Python, or both for separate analysis and then
combine the findings to create a hybrid model

● You are free to select a different stock to analyze and news dataset
as well while not changing the objective of the task.
